Coffee Monitor
==============

A purely for fun and learning project to allow folks to know from across the
office when a new pot of coffee is brewing and will soon be ready.

Technology
----------

* [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/)
* [Redis](http://redis.io/)

Data Persistence
----------------

Data is persisted exclusively in Redis. Some of the objects and well-known keys
are as follows:

* Coffee maker set
  - name: 'makers'
  - type: set
* Coffee makers
  - name: 'maker:%id%'
  - type: hash
  - attributes: id, name, model, brewTime (seconds)
* Coffee pot set
  - name: 'pots'
  - type: set
* Coffee pots
  - name: 'pot:%id%'
  - type: hash
  - attributes: id, name, color, lastBrew, readyAt, currentLevel, removed
* Brews set
  - name: 'brews'
  - type: sorted set by time of brew
  - format: '%brewId%|%makerId%|%potId%'
  - Note: we also add sets for each pot and maker, with names
    'maker:%id%:brews', 'pot:%id%:brews', etc.
* Brews
  - name: 'brew:%id%'
  - type: hash
  - attributes: id, createdAt, creationIp, makerId, potId
* Other one-off config values:
  - 'nextMakerId', integer
  - 'nextPotId', integer
  - 'nextBrewId', integer

Use of Socket.IO
----------------

We use Socket.IO for real-time updates to the recent brews list. The following
events are utilized:

### Emitted by server

#### updateBrew

This is broadcast to all currently connected clients. It contains a rendered
version of a brew that was just created in the system, or one that was updated.

#### deleteBrew

This is broadcast to all currently connected clients. It contains just the ID
of the brew that was deleted.

#### recentBrews

The server responds with a rendered version of the most recent brews we know
about. This is the same as the contents of the '#brews' div.

This event is sent automatically when a client connects to make sure they have
the most recent list of brews.

#### updatePot

This is broadcast to all currently connected clients.  It sends the JSON object
representing all of the pots currently in the system, including how full they
are, whether they are in the caddy, etc.

### Emitted by client

#### recentBrews

Emit this event when you wish to get a list of recent brews sent your way.

TODO List
---------

* Track currently connected clients (by IP?)
* Tweet brewed pots? (https://github.com/ttezel/twit)
* Send emails to people that want them
* Jabber IMs?
